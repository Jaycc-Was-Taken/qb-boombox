# CHANGES MADE BY JAYCC
-I reworked it to utilize the current QB-Menu, rather than the edited one.
# WORKING ON BY JAYCC
-I'll be looking into a way to change volume, I'm 99% sure its already possible I just need to utilize it with the xyz-3dsounds and figure out a good way to adjust volume.  Will either utilize a number input or a slider value for volume adjustments at some point.
# Description
This is a script that let's the player have a useable boombox item in their inventory and use it to play songs/sounds.
# Usage
Add song mp3/ogg files to the xyz-3dsounds resource, and add them to the qb-boombox config. In its current state, the menu will only display the tapes/songs that you have available in your inventory, via GetPlayerData().items in the client.

I have included a pdn template file I've used to create tape/song inventory images, using real covers, and an example of one of them.

This script currently uses my own version of qb-menu, xyz-3dsound, and mnm_notify as dependencies. The latter 2 are available on github, and I will probably release qb-menu soon.
